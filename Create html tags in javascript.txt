You can create html element as objects in JavaScript using document.createElement() method,

To create and store following html string in JavaScript as an object:
<p>An absolute URL: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">W3Schools</a></p>

You will first need to create parent <p> tag as follows,

var ptag = document.createElement('p');
ptag.innerText = 'An absolute URL:';
Next you will need to create anchor tag object as follows,

var anchorTag = document.createElement('a');
anchroTag.href = 'https://www.w3schools.com';
anchorTag.innerText = 'w3Schools';
Next append anchor tag as child to <p> tag as follows,

ptag.appendChild(anchorTag);
This way now you can refer your object ptag and anchorTag latter.
